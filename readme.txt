HDCommerce, the ultimate eCommerce experience. *In beta.

== Description ==

HDCommerce was designed and built from the ground up to innovate in eCommerce UI. My goal is to make creating and managing products as easy and quick as possible by using a clean and intuitive user interface designed for *customers*, not developers (although developers will love it too!).

This is a brand-new plugin attempting to tackle one of the most important and complex needs on the internet, and as such, some features you require may not be included in HDCommerce yet. Please check the section titled "Upcoming Features" to see if there is anything there that you need.

This latest version added too many features and improvements to list them all, but here are some of the largest.

* new coupon module!
* -- percent or amount based discounts
* -- auto expire date
* -- limited to only certain categories OR certain products
* -- only valid if [x] amount is in the cart (pre tax and shipping)
* completly revamped and upgraded product edit pages
* full stock control and management
* export orders as CSV
* payment gateways now pluggable (so devs can easily add additional gateways)
* set default variation (so that variation is selected by default on product page)
* shop/category page inline display (1,2,3, and 4 column views)

* **hundreds** of bug fixes, improvements, and enhancements.

>== HOW TO USE | TUTORIAL ==

Full tutorial and documentation is still being written. This section, along with a link to the full documentation will be updated ASAP.

== Installation ==

The plugin can be installed like any other.

1. Log into WordPress
1. Select Plugins, then Add New
1. Select Upload Plugin
1. Choose the zip file, then Install and activate

Once installed, you will need select HDCommerce from the left sidebar to set up your global store options such as countries you will be selling to, currency, and payment gateway.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==


= How do I reorder a variation? =

The order that the unique products appear on the edit product page doesn't matter on the front end. You can re-order the variations (left panel) by dragging and dropping.

= How do I change the number of columns on the shop and category page =

You can goto HDCommerce -> Advanced -> and change the Default Product View Type / Columns setting

= My theme is displaying product titles twice =

No problem! Every theme is coded and designed differently. By default, HDCommerce displays product titles as an H2 tag. You can change this to an H1, H3, or even remove it altogether in the HDCommerce settings -> Advanced section.

= Help, my cart is being cached! =

HDCommerce is compatible with WP Fastest Cache out of the box, and we should be compatible with W3 Total Cache, WP Super Cache, WP Rocket, Comet Cache, and Cachify as well. If you are having caching problems, most cache plugins have an "excludes" setting where you can add custom pages so they won't get cached. As HDCommerce grows, more cache plugins will start to offer compatibility with us automatically.
